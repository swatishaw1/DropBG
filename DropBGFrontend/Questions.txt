what is this 
{clipPath: `inset(0 ${100.2 - sliderPosition}% 0 0)`}?
{{clipPath: `inset(0 0 0 ${sliderPosition}%)`}} in BgSlider

1️⃣ For the original image:
clipPath: `inset(0 ${100.2 - sliderPosition}% 0 0)`
When sliderPosition = 0, that becomes inset(0 100.2% 0 0) → right side is fully cut off (nothing visible).
When sliderPosition = 100, that becomes inset(0 0.2% 0 0) → right side almost fully visible.
So as you move the slider, the visible area of the original image increases from left → right.
That’s why you subtract sliderPosition from 100 — the opposite motion.

2️⃣ For the processed image:
clipPath: `inset(0 0 0 ${sliderPosition}%)`
When sliderPosition = 0, → inset(0 0 0 0) → fully visible (no left cut).
When sliderPosition = 100, → inset(0 0 0 100%) → fully hidden.
So this one hides from left → right as the slider moves.

🧠 So Together
Both clip paths move in opposite directions:
One reveals the original,
The other hides the processed version,
Result → smooth before/after split controlled by slider.

🔹 Why 100.2 instead of 100
That 0.2 is a tiny buffer to avoid a 1px white gap at the edge (browser rounding errors in percentages).
Without it, some browsers may show a thin line between the images when the slider is exactly at 50%.

M24 7.3   → move to (24, 7.3)
h-5       → horizontal line left by 5
1         → (this looks like a typo; probably meant 'h1' or 'l1' but '1' alone is invalid)
L22.3.4   → line to (22.3, 0.4)
H17       → horizontal line to x=17
l-3.4 6.9 → line relative (-3.4, 6.9)
v10.3     → vertical line down 10.3
H24       → horizontal line to x=24
V7.3      → vertical line up to y=7.3
z         → close the shape

currentColor is a special CSS keyword that means “use the element’s current text color.”
